Working with savefiles has been remade pretty much entirely from how it was in YoYoYo. Generally, you no longer need to
do any preparation to make a value saveable, no changes to scrSaveGame. Saved values are accessed with savedata_set()
and savedata_get(). The remaining scripts are much less commonly used for niche needs.

For example, if you wanted to make a cutscene that only plays once, you would first check for a savedata_get("seenCutscene").
You don't need to worry whether the value exists - if it doesn't, 0 is returned. At the end of the cutscene, you would
savedata_set("seenCutscene", true) to set the variable. Then, if the player saves, this value will stay saved. If you
want the value to stay saved even if the player doesn't save, use savedata_set_persistent.
